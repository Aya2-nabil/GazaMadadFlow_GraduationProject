# Gaza Madad Flow Workflow Automation

## Overview

**Gaza Madad Flow** is a humanitarian aid registration automation tool designed for Gaza's emergency situations, particularly following the war in October 2023. It simplifies the registration process for citizens needing aid by allowing them to submit their information once, which is then automatically processed and forwarded to multiple aid platforms. This workflow leverages tools like Google Sheets, Google Forms, and n8n to streamline data collection, validation, and submission.
